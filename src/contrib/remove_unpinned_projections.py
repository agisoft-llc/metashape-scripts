Remove Unpinned Projections
Jason Hinsley Sept. 2024
Usage:Workflow -> Batch Process -> Add -> Run script to add to menu.
Select Scripts -> Remove Unpinned Projections

This script will check that markers exist in the current chunk and remove unpinned projections (blue flags) from those markers.
Once unpinned projections are removed, update transform will be executed to make the changes take effect.
Blue (unpinned) markers usually are related to the automatically placed projections, green (pinned) markers are those that are adjusted or placed by user manually.
Both blue and green markers are considered during optimization.
