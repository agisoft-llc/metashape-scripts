"""
Metashape Mesh debris Filter Script (v 1.1)
Kent Mori, Feb 2022

Usage:
Workflow -> Batch Process -> Add -> Run script
This script scans the number of components in a model and reduceing them continuously to 1 (by force).
I wanted to make "grasdual selection" tool, but this is slower than that.
